# Vector_Database
Small vector database built using Weaviate and Javascript for understanding theory and application

Followed this tutorial for practice:

Personal notes are in notes.md that cover some of the theory and problems I ran into with getting the tutorial to work
correctly. One problem was a mismatch between variable names for environment variables, not correctly migrating the data.js
file into the database prior to running the final command, and file names being incorrect in different parts of the tutorial. 

Apart from that it was a fun exercise!
